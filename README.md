# A Scoreboard App Created with React

This is a code-along project that was my first introduction to React.

I learned a lot of the higher concepts of React. It proved to be a very useful tutorial. It instilled a love of React almost immediately.

Of Particular interest to me is the breaking down of an app into it's base components. I find it easier to understand how an app works when it is broken into smaller chunks.

The app employs many of the concepts necessary for larger React apps despite it's small size.
